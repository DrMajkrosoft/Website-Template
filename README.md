The basic setup for Bootstrap web page. It's not rocket science, it's just copy/paste code. I made this so that everytime when I'm working on a new project, I don't have to type the links for stylesheets in the head tag everytime and basically I don't have to set up the basic HTML template everytime.

# Installation


1. Open the terminal in ``Website Template`` directory, and enter the following command first.
```bash
sudo npm i 
```

2. Run the following command in your terminal, in your **current working directory**, in order to configure ESLint file.
```bash
npm run eslint
```
3. Navigate to `src` folder and edit your files from there.
After you start developing, run this command in your terminal in order to see your code in your default browser.
```bash
npm run start
```
