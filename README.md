The basic setup for Bootstrap web page. It's not rocket science, it's just copy/paste code. I made this so that everytime when I'm working on a new project, I don't have to type the links for stylesheets in the head tag everytime and basically I don't have to set up the basic HTML template everytime.

# Instalation


1. Open the terminal in ``Website Template`` directory, and enter the following command first.
```bash
sudo npm i 
```

2. Run the following command in your terminal, in your **current working directory**, in order to configure ESLint file.
```bash
npm run eslint
```
3. Navigate to `src` folder and edit your files from there.
After you start developing, run this command in your terminal in order to see your code in your default browser.
```bash
npm run start
```

If you don't know how ES7 (ECMAScript 2016) code looks like, it looks something like this

```javascript
// Importing libraries
import className from 'javascriptlibrary';

// Declaring variables
let mssg = 'Hello World!';
const button = document.getElementById('btn');

// Arrow function
var showMessage = () => alert(mssg);

// Promises (async)
var get = url => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // JSON GET Method
  });
}
let promise = get('URL');
promise.then(() => {
   // code
}).then(() => {
   // code
}).catch(() => {
  // if error
});

// onload event
self.addEventListener('load', showMessage());
```

You can't write code like that and use it in your browser because web browsers don't support ES7 code yet. You need a compiler for that. In this project, I've implemented **Babel**. See the [documentation]("https://github.com/babel/babel") for more info.

Starting from **Google Chrome v61+**, **ES6** is compiled natively.
