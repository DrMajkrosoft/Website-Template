The basic setup for Bootstrap web page. It's not rocket science, it's just copy/paste code. I made this so that everytime when I work on a new project, I don't have to type the links for stylesheets in the head tag every time.

First, install the ``npm`` package manager : https://nodejs.org/

Then open up command line and type :

``npm install -g lite-server``

After that, go to ''Website-Template'' repository and type :

``lite-server``

That's it. Your development environment is now set up.
