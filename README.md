The basic setup for Bootstrap web page. It's not rocket science, it's just copy/paste code. I made this so that everytime when I'm working on a new project, I don't have to type the links for stylesheets in the head tag every time and basically I don't have to set up the basic HTML template everytime.

## Configuration

First, install the ``npm`` package manager : https://nodejs.org/

Then open up command line and type :

``npm install -g lite-server``

After that, go to ''Website-Template'' repository and type :

``lite-server``

That's it. Your development environment is now set up.

## Info about the upcoming "React.js IDE"

Also if you are working on a React.js website, there is now an IDE for React.js development.
