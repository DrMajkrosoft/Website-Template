# Bootstrap Webpage Template

The basic setup for Bootstrap web page. It's not rocket science, it's just copy/paste code. I made this so that everytime when I'm working on a new project, I don't have to type the links for stylesheets in the head tag everytime and basically I don't have to set up the basic HTML template everytime.

# Configuration

First, install the `npm` package manager : <https://nodejs.org/>

Then open up command line and type :

```bash
npm i -g lite-server
```

After that, go to ''Website-Template'' repository and type :

```bash
lite-server
```

That's it. Your development environment is now set up.

# Usage


1. Open the terminal in ``Website Template`` directory, and enter the following command first.
```bash
sudo npm i 
```

2. Run the following command in your terminal, in your **current working directory**, in order to configure ESLint file.
```bash
eslint --init
```
3. Navigate to `src` folder and edit your files from there.
After you start developing, run this command in your terminal in order to see your code in your default browser.
```bash
npm run build
```
Run this command every time you want to see compiled ES7 JavaScript code.

If you don't know how ES7 (ECMAScript 2016) code looks like, it looks something like this

```javascript
// Importing libraries
import className from 'javascriptlibrary'

// Declaring variables
const mssg = "Hello World!";
let button = document.getElementById('btn');

function showMessage() {
  alert(mssg);
}

button.addEventListener('click', showMessage());
```

You can't write code like that and use it in your browser because web browsers don't support ES7 code yet. You need a compiler for that. In this project, I've implemented **Babel**. See the [documentation]("https://github.com/babel/babel") for more info.

Starting from **Google Chrome v61+**, **ES6** is compiled natively.

I also **recommend** importing these so that your images scale **properly** on every device. These are only for the landing page.

```html
 <picture>
   <!-- Full HD Resolution -->
   <source srcset="https://placehold.it/1920x1080" media="(min-width: 1920px)" />
   <!-- Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge -->
   <source srcset="https://placehold.it/1442x2562" media="(min-width: 1442px)" />
   <!-- HiDPI Laptop -->
   <source srcset="https://placehold.it/1440x900" media="(min-width: 1440px)" />
   <!-- Common Resolution -->
   <source srcset="https://placehold.it/1366x768" media="(min-width: 1366px)" />
   <!-- 4:3 (Old CRT monitors) -->
   <source srcset="https://placehold.it/1280x1024" media="(min-width: 1280px)" />
   <!-- iPad Pro -->
   <source srcset="https://placehold.it/1024x1366" media="(min-width: 1024px)" />
   <!-- iPad -->
   <source srcset="https://placehold.it/768x1024" media="(min-width: 768px)" />
   <!-- iPhone 6 Plus -->
   <source srcset="https://placehold.it/414x736" media="(min-width: 414px)" />
   <!-- Google Nexus 5X -->
   <source srcset="https://placehold.it/412x732" media="(min-width: 412px)" />
   <!-- iPhone 6 -->
   <source srcset="https://placehold.it/375x667" media="(min-width: 375px)" />
   <!-- iPhone 5 -->
   <source srcset="https://placehold.it/320x568" media="(min-width: 320px)" />
   <!-- If the browser doesn't support "srcset" attribute, then load the default resolution -->
   <img src="https://placehold.it/1366x768" alt="Background"/>
 </picture>
```

If you don't want to write code for responsive images in `HTML`, you can also do it in `CSS`

```css
  img {
    background-image: url('path-to-image');
    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover;
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  }
```
